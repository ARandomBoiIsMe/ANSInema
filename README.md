# Render images and videos in your terminal

I was curious about how image/video viewers worked, and if I could make one in my terminal. So, I decided to kill two
birds with one poorly-named stone.

# Dependencies

- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)

# Supported file types

- Video: Most likely all. FFmpeg is quite robust.
- Image: `.bmp` (more image formats coming soon...)

# Usage

Make sure to uncomment the appropriate code blocks in the `main.py` file before running the command
```
python main.py
```
